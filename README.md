## Overview

This repository contains the project files for SC1015 Mini-Project.

Students normally experience a huge jump when transitioning from tertiary education to university. Hence, our machine learning aims to predict how well students can cope in university based on their various backgrounds so that students and teachers both know what to expect, to enable targeted interventions that can help reduce dropout rates and enhance student performance.

Here is a brief overview of our source code:
1. Reclassificaion & Dataset Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis / Visualization
3. Implementing Machine Learning Models
4. Conclusion
